    excerpt:
      "Learn how to build modern web applications with Next.js 16, including the new App Router and React Server Components.",
    content: `<h2>Introduction</h2><p>Next.js 16 represents a major leap forward in React-based web development. With its improved App Router, enhanced server components, and better performance optimizations, it's never been a better time to start building with Next.js.</p><h2>Setting Up Your Project</h2><p>Getting started is straightforward. Run <code>npx create-next-app@latest</code> and select the options that fit your project. The new project template includes TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint by default.</p><h2>App Router</h2><p>The App Router is the recommended way to build new applications. It uses a file-system based router where folders define routes. Each route segment maps to a URL segment.</p><h3>Layouts</h3><p>Layouts let you share UI between route segments. They preserve state, remain interactive, and don't re-render on navigation.</p><h3>Server Components</h3><p>By default, all components in the App Router are React Server Components. This means they render on the server and send minimal JavaScript to the client.</p><h2>Data Fetching</h2><p>Server Components can be async, allowing you to use <code>await</code> directly in your component. This simplifies data fetching significantly compared to <code>getServerSideProps</code>.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Next.js 16 makes building performant web applications easier than ever. Start experimenting with the App Router and Server Components to see the benefits firsthand.</p>`,

    title: "TypeScript Best Practices in 2026",
    excerpt:
      "Comprehensive guide to writing clean, maintainable TypeScript code with modern patterns and conventions.",
    content: `<h2>Why TypeScript?</h2><p>TypeScript has become the de facto standard for large-scale JavaScript applications. Its type system catches errors early, improves IDE support, and makes refactoring safer.</p><h2>Use Strict Mode</h2><p>Always enable <code>strict: true</code> in your tsconfig.json. This enables all strict type-checking options and helps catch more bugs at compile time.</p><h2>Prefer Interfaces Over Types</h2><p>Use interfaces for object shapes that might be extended. Use type aliases for unions, intersections, and computed types.</p><h2>Avoid <code>any</code></h2><p>The <code>any</code> type defeats the purpose of TypeScript. Use <code>unknown</code> when you don't know the type, and narrow it with type guards.</p><h2>Use Generics Wisely</h2><p>Generics make your code reusable without sacrificing type safety. Use them for utility functions, data structures, and API clients.</p><h2>Const Assertions</h2><p>Use <code>as const</code> to create readonly types from literal values. This is especially useful for configuration objects and enum-like constants.</p><h2>Template Literal Types</h2><p>TypeScript 4.1+ supports template literal types, enabling powerful string manipulation at the type level.</p>`,

    content: `<h2>Project Setup</h2><p>We'll build a complete REST API using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript. This API will include CRUD operations, authentication, input validation, and error handling.</p><h2>Installing Dependencies</h2><p>Start by initializing your project and installing the necessary packages: express, cors, helmet, and their TypeScript type definitions.</p><h2>Structuring Your Project</h2><p>A well-organized project structure is crucial for maintainability. We recommend the following: <code>src/routes</code>, <code>src/controllers</code>, <code>src/services</code>, <code>src/middleware</code>, and <code>src/models</code>.</p><h2>Error Handling</h2><p>Implement a global error handler middleware that catches all unhandled errors and returns consistent error responses.</p><h2>Input Validation</h2><p>Use a validation library like Zod to validate request bodies, query parameters, and route parameters. This prevents invalid data from reaching your business logic.</p><h2>Authentication</h2><p>Implement JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens. Store refresh tokens securely and implement token rotation.</p>`,

    content: `<h2>The Hook Model</h2><p>React hooks revolutionized how we write components. Understanding the rules of hooks and the component lifecycle is essential for writing bug-free code.</p><h2>useReducer for Complex State</h2><p>When state logic is complex or involves multiple sub-values, <code>useReducer</code> is preferable to <code>useState</code>. It also helps when the next state depends on the previous one.</p><h2>Custom Hooks</h2><p>Extract reusable logic into custom hooks. Follow the convention of prefixing with "use" and ensure your hooks are composable.</p><h2>useCallback and useMemo</h2><p>These hooks are for performance optimization. Use <code>useCallback</code> to memoize functions and <code>useMemo</code> to memoize expensive computations.</p><h2>Common Pitfalls</h2><p>Avoid storing derived state, respect the dependency array rules, and don't put hooks inside conditions or loops.</p>`,

Start with a base image, copy your source code, install dependencies, and define the start command.</p><h2>Docker Compose</h2><p>Docker Compose lets you define multi-container applications. Define your app, database, cache, and other services in a single <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file.</p><h2>Multi-Stage Builds</h2><p>Use multi-stage builds to create smaller production images. Build your application in one stage and copy only the necessary artifacts to the final stage.</p><h2>Production Tips</h2><p>Use non-root users, implement health checks, manage secrets properly, and set up logging and monitoring.</p>`,

Use <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> to understand how your queries are executed and identify bottlenecks.</p><h2>Indexing Strategies</h2><p>B-tree indexes are the default and most common. Consider GIN indexes for full-text search, GiST for geometric data, and partial indexes for filtered queries.</p><h2>Connection Pooling</h2><p>Use PgBouncer or built-in connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently, especially in high-concurrency applications.</p><h2>Configuration Tuning</h2><p>Key parameters to tune: <code>shared_buffers</code>, <code>work_mem</code>, <code>maintenance_work_mem</code>, and <code>effective_cache_size</code>. Base these on your available RAM and workload.</p><h2>Vacuum and Autovacuum</h2><p>PostgreSQL uses MVCC, which means dead tuples accumulate.

Use CSS custom properties for runtime theming.</p><h2>Component Patterns</h2><p>Create consistent UI patterns using Tailwind. Cards, buttons, forms, and navigation components can all be built with utility classes.</p><h2>Dark Mode</h2><p>Tailwind's dark mode support is excellent. Use the <code>dark:</code> variant prefix to style your components for dark mode.</p><h2>Responsive Design</h2><p>Mobile-first responsive design is built into Tailwind. Use breakpoint prefixes like <code>sm:</code>, <code>md:</code>, <code>lg:</code> to adapt your layout.</p><h2>Performance</h2><p>Tailwind's JIT compiler generates only the CSS you use.

They work well for APIs and microservices but require careful implementation to be secure.</p><h2>Session-Based Auth</h2><p>Traditional session-based authentication stores session data on the server. It's simpler to implement and easier to revoke access.</p><h2>OAuth 2.0</h2><p>OAuth enables third-party authentication (Google, GitHub, etc.). It's complex but widely adopted and well-understood.</p><h2>Passwordless</h2><p>Magic links and passkeys are gaining popularity. They eliminate password-related security issues entirely.</p><h2>Best Practices</h2><p>Always hash passwords with bcrypt, use HTTPS, implement rate limiting, and consider multi-factor authentication for sensitive applications.</p>`,

GraphQL reduces round trips but may be slower for complex queries without proper optimization.</p><h2>When to Choose REST</h2><p>Choose REST for file uploads, simple CRUD apps, and when HTTP caching is important.</p><h2>When to Choose GraphQL</h2><p>Choose GraphQL for complex data relationships, mobile apps needing bandwidth optimization, and rapid iteration on frontend data needs.</p>`,

Supports middleware and devtools.</p><h2>Jotai</h2><p>Atomic state management inspired by Recoil. Each piece of state is an atom. Excellent for derived state and bottom-up composition.</p><h2>Redux Toolkit</h2><p>Still the best choice for complex applications with lots of business logic. RTK Query handles data fetching elegantly.</p><h2>Server State</h2><p>For server-side data, prefer TanStack Query (React Query) over traditional state management. It handles caching, deduplication, and revalidation automatically.</p>`,
